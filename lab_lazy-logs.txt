  Eliminate allocation from sbrk():
  1: 删除 kernel/sysproc.c 中 sys_sbrk 的 growproc 部分，只增加进程的 sz
  2: According to lab doc，when we use echo hi, it will show:
      usertrap():...
      panic: uvmunmap
     because:
      echo hi -> getcmd in main in sh.c -> parsecmd -> parseline -> parsepipe -> parseexec -> exe    ccmd -> malloc in umalloc.c -> morecore
      in morecore:
        p = sbrk(...);
        hp = (Header*)p;
        hp->s.size = nu;
      hp points to a memory unallocated, so print "usertrap():..."
      then kill this process, freeproc() is called, freeproc -> proc_freepagetable -> uvmfree ->     uvmunmap, so panic: uvmunmap: not mapped
 
 Lazy allocation:
 1: Allocate a physical memory and set a mapping in the process pagetable for the page fault caused by lazy allocation which means the value of stval is less than p->sz and scause is 13 or 15. We should check these.
 2: Delete panic("not map") in uvmunmap in vm.c, and just make it continue when it comes to PTE_V unseted.
