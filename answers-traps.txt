Register a2 holds 13 in main's call to printf.

There are no calls to f and g. Assembly code just use 12 as f(8)+1 at address 0x26.

Printf is located at 0x630.

The value in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main is 0x38.

The output is "HE110 World",and if the RISC-V were instead big-endian, we could set i to 0x726c6400 to yield the same output. We needn't to change 57616 to a different value.

THe value of the register a2 will be printed after 'y=', because the third argument should be passed in the register a2 in the C calling conventions for RISC-V.
